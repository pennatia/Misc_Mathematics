Module Info:
Module 6 - Mathematical Sequences (Due 07/11/2021 11:59 PM)

Approach: 
Catalan.py - the code takes the concepts learned in the last module to define a function capable of 
performing the calculation of various catalan numbers (within a specified range). The code sets up 
a conditional base case, and then performs the necessary calculation as defined in the module hand-out. 
I must give credit to Digital Ocean for the resources I leveraged in writing the snippet (more can be found 
at the following link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-for-program-for-nth-catalan-number/)
Pascal.py - the code applies the same concepts to the creation of a pascal triangle of N rows. The function
performs a basic operation recursively, calling upon itself to perform the calculations required, then 
outputting the desired result for a given N number of rows. Here, I must thank some of the folks on 
StackOverflow, who greatly helped me conceptualize the function loop itself. 

Known Bugs: 
N/A
